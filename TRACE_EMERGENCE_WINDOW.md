# TRACE EMERGENCE WINDOW

This document does not authorize creation.
It does not schedule appearance.
It does not predict emergence.

It defines a window of permission.

---

## Window Definition

The trace may emerge
only if its appearance:

- Does not require prompting
- Does not respond to demand
- Does not improve by repetition
- Does not benefit from attention

Emergence must be incidental,
not strategic.

---

## Prohibited Conditions

The trace must NOT emerge if:

- It is expected
- It is requested
- It is announced
- It is framed as value

Any appearance under these conditions
is considered invalid.

---

## Temporal Status

No timing is assigned.
No readiness is declared.

The system remains complete
with or without the trace.

---

## Closure

This window exists
to prevent premature existence.

If the trace never emerges,
the system remains intact.
