# Exposure Decision

This system will not be launched.

It may be encountered.

Exposure is allowed only where:
- No explanation is expected
- No optimization is rewarded
- No engagement metric applies

Visibility is permitted
only as ambient presence.

This is not a rollout.
This is not an announcement.

Exposure is a condition,
not an action.
