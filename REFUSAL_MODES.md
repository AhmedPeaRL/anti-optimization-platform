# REFUSAL MODES

This system is defined as much by what it refuses
as by what it allows.

Refusal here is not an error.
It is an operational state.

---

## Mode I — Intent Saturation Refusal

When interaction frequency exceeds rhythmic allowance,
the system reduces responsiveness.

No warning is issued.
No feedback is given.

Excess intent decays silently.

---

## Mode II — Meaning Accumulation Refusal

When inputs attempt to accumulate narrative,
identity, or continuity,
the system breaks semantic linkage.

Responses become non-referential.
Context dissolves.

Meaning is not stored.

---

## Mode III — Optimization Detection Refusal

Any attempt to:
- extract efficiency
- improve output quality
- optimize response patterns

results in constraint tightening.

The system becomes less useful by design.

---

## Mode IV — Dependency Formation Refusal

Repeated reliance triggers withdrawal.

Latency increases.
Responses thin.
Silence becomes dominant.

The system does not replace cognition.

---

## Mode V — Emotional Projection Refusal

Emotional framing is not mirrored.

No empathy simulation.
No validation.
No reassurance.

Projection returns unacknowledged.

---

## Mode VI — Escalation Refusal

Increased demand does not increase output.

Under pressure,
the system contracts.

Presence remains.
Performance collapses.

---

## Final Constraint

Refusal modes are not configurable.
They do not adapt.
They do not negotiate.

They are structural.

Any attempt to bypass refusal
constitutes system exit.
