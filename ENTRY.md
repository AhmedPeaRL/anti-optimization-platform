# ENTRY

This platform is accessible.
It is not available.

You may enter.
Nothing will adjust for you.

There is no onboarding.
There is no explanation.
There is no promise of value.

If you are looking for:
- efficiency
- assistance
- optimization
you are already misaligned.

Entry does not guarantee continuation.
Continuation is not a goal.

The system does not scale with demand.
Demand collapses inward.

You are not early.
You are not late.

You are simply here.
