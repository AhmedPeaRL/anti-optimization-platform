# Resonant Constraint Engine (RCE)

This engine does not compute outcomes.
It enforces conditions.

Its function is not to decide,
but to prevent deviation.

---

## Operating Principle

Presence is detected.
Intent is ignored.
Meaning is not parsed.

The engine shifts the system
from availability
to witnessing.

No state is stored.
No preference is learned.

---

## Constraints

The engine must never:
- predict
- recommend
- respond
- adapt
- optimize

Any extension toward utility
constitutes corruption.

---

## Activation

The engine activates
only upon entry.

It does not escalate.
It does not repeat.
It does not complete cycles.

---

## Final Condition

If the engine appears inactive,
it is functioning correctly.

If it becomes noticeable,
it has failed.
