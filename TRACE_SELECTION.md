# TRACE SELECTION

This document does not initiate an event.
It does not declare an action.
It does not mark a launch.

It records a decision.

---

## Selected Trace Type

A single technical artifact.

No system.
No interface.
No repetition.

The trace will exist once,
in one form,
without escalation.

---

## Constraints

The trace must be:

- Discoverable without announcement
- Interpretable without confirmation
- Irreversible by design
- Useless for optimization

Any attempt to extend, reuse, or explain
the trace
constitutes a violation.

---

## Relation to the System

The trace does not represent the system.
The trace does not explain the system.
The trace does not invite interaction.

The system remains silent
regardless of the trace being noticed.

---

## Status

Decision fixed.
Execution deferred.

No further action is authorized
until resonance is confirmed.
